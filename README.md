# Post api

api for lab4

[deployed url](https://pedantic-hopper-11e40f.netlify.app/)
[deployed url](https://lab-5-cs52.herokuapp.com/)


## What Worked Well
Creating my own api was really nice becuase I know exactly what data is being stored, and how they are being stored. There's also no limit in the amount of fields

## What Didn't
I think refractoring the code from lab 4 to work with lab 5 data base was very messy 

## Extra Credit
array for tags but instead of tags, I used it for my pictures
