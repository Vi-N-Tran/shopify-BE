# About
This is the BE challenge for Shopify's BE internship. The idea was to create a platform that "sells NFTs" of stars (pictures taken from NASA api so we can't really sell them but imagine! ) 
This BE was made to go with my (Vi Tran's) Front End portion so routes were made with the intention of connecting the two together later on. Also has search functions to look for key words in descriptions.

## Tests
